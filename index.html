<h2> <p> What makes a superhero? </p> </h2>
    <p> <first h2>  
    A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    So in order to be a superhero, <b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. </first h2> </p> 
  
    <p> <first h2> 
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
    If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero. </first h2> </p> </a>

    <p><third h2> Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, 
        a trained warrior in the sheltered Amazon island of Themyscira. In 1918, when the American pilot Steve Trevor 
        crashes offshore and tells Diana about World War I and the conflict in the outside world, 
        she leaves home to embark on a journey to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny.
